# Empathy map
1. WHO are we empathizing with? 
> Who is the person we want to understand?
> What is the situation they are in?
> What is their role in the situation?
- We are empathizing with RMs (Relationship Managers), end-customers and potential customers of the travel company's in-house call management centre (CMC).
- RMs want to be matched with a customer based on the RM's skills and customer's profile.
- Customers want to be matched with a RM whose skills are best fit to help with the objective of the call.
- For outbound calls, RMs are looking totarget potential buyers with the company's products and services.
- For inbound calls, customers are looking to be best routed to a RM that's most suitable for their inquiry without having to wait too long.

2. What do they need to DO?
> What do they need to do differently?
> What job(s) do they want or need to get done?
> What decision(s) do they need to make?
> How will we know they were successful?
- RMs need to take a 10 minutes questionnaire which is used to build the RM's profile and skill matrix for the system.
- The RM's profile needs to be automatically adjusted by the system appropriately based on the RM's subsequent performance in selling packages and serving customers.
- RMs each need to use their won individualised target lists generated by the system to connect with potential customers on the selling the company's products and services.
- During bysu times, customers won't get immediately directed to a human RM, rather an Interactive Voice Response unit instead. The customer then needs to select from a number of call options to then be correctly routed to an appropriate RM.

3. What do they SEE?
> What do they see in the marketplace?
> What do they see in their immediate environment?
> What do they see others saying and doing?
> What are they watching and reading?
- They see a way that can help them to improve their system and number of sales by using a profiling tool
- The customers can see a change in how their relational managers deal with their customers.
- The relational managers see a better environment that will help them reduce stress via distribution routine and call routing, this will help the team to work more efficiently.

4. What do they SAY?
> What have we heard them say?
> What can we imagine them saying?
- They have an automated device that tells them options on why they are calling, helping them to redirect a call
- Customers are spoken to by suitable Relationship managers that will give them the best sales pitch, makes it more 

5. What do they DO?
> What do they do today?
> What behavior have we observed?
> What can we imagine them doing?

6. What do they HEAR?
> What are they hearing others say?
> What are they hearing from friends?
> What are they hearing from colleagues?
> What are they hearing second-hand?

7. What do they THINK and FEEL?
> PAINS | What are their fears, frustrations, and anxieties?
> GAINS | What are their wants, needs, hopes and dreams?
> What other thoughts and feelings might motivate their behavior?
- Cusomters who suffer long wait time will feel annoyed, unappreciated by the organisation and RM.
- Potential customers targeted by the system repeatedly will feel annoyed and view the company as untrustworthy if they have advised the RM to not call again.
- Cusomters calling in want to resolve their issue prompty, have detailed product information explained clearly by a knowledgable RM and purchased correctly handled when purchasing over the phone.
