# Problem definition
## Problem definition
- The relationship managers have specific holiday packages that they know better than others. If customers were to call them regarding different holiday packages, it will be harder to make the sale.
- Some customers might be caught in a waiting queue, this might make customers disinterest to ask questions, because of this the company might lose some customers.
- The flow rate of customers might be a burden for relationship mangers. 
- The efficiency of calls is not maximised, relationship managers are just trying to make sales for all products and not products that they are knowledgeable about. 

## Statement
The in-house call management centre (CMC) system needs to be improved by adjusting the inbound flow rate to each Relationship Manager (RM), matching each customer call to the appropriate RM based on both profiles, and assist RM directly through generating individualised target lists for outbound calls.
## Objectives
- provide assistance to RMs in serving their end-customers (or potential customers) 
- match RMs and end-customers according to RMs skills (performance and product knowledge) and customers profiles. 
- Interactive Voice Response Unit

## Stakeholders 
- Customers
- RMs
- Travel Company
- Programmers
- Competitors
- Airline company
- Business Analyst
- Partners offering the travel accommodations, transport and meals
- Hotel companies

# Empathy map
1. WHO are we empathizing with? 
> Who is the person we want to understand?
> What is the situation they are in?
> What is their role in the situation?
- We are empathizing with RMs (Relationship Managers), end-customers and potential customers of the travel company's in-house call management centre (CMC).
- RMs want to be matched with a customer based on the RM's skills and customer's profile.
- Customers want to be matched with a RM whose skills are best fit to help with the objective of the call.
- For outbound calls, RMs are looking totarget potential buyers with the company's products and services.
- For inbound calls, customers are looking to be best routed to a RM that's most suitable for their inquiry without having to wait too long.

2. What do they need to DO?
> What do they need to do differently?
> What job(s) do they want or need to get done?
> What decision(s) do they need to make?
> How will we know they were successful?
- RMs need to take a 10 minutes questionnaire which is used to build the RM's profile and skill matrix for the system.
- The RM's profile needs to be automatically adjusted by the system appropriately based on the RM's subsequent performance in selling packages and serving customers.
- RMs each need to use their own individualised target lists generated by the system to connect with potential customers on the selling the company's products and services.
- During busy times, customers won't get immediately directed to a human RM, rather an Interactive Voice Response unit instead. The customer then needs to select from a number of call options to then be correctly routed to an appropriate RM.

3. What do they SEE?
> What do they see in the marketplace?
> What do they see in their immediate environment?
> What do they see others saying and doing?
> What are they watching and reading?
- The business analysts see a way that can improve their system effectiveness and number of sales by using a profiling tool
- The customers can see a change in how their relational managers deal with their customers.
- The relational managers see a better environment that will help them reduce stress via distribution routine and call routing, this will help the team to work more efficiently.

4. What do they SAY?
> What have we heard them say?
> What can we imagine them saying?
- They have an automated device that tells them options on why they are calling, helping them to redirect a call
- Customers are spoken to by suitable Relationship managers that will give them the best sales pitch, makes it more 
- Inbound customers may have to give a reason for their call if there is long wait times

5. What do they DO?
> What do they do today?
> What behavior have we observed?
> What can we imagine them doing?
- Inbound customers will call the company and navigate the automatic call routing software
- Outbound customers will be called my an RM and be given a sales pitch
- RMs will either await inbound calls or work on outbound calls with a script
- Inbound customers with long wait times will give their reason for a call.
- Inbound customers with long wait times may hang up.
- Outbound customers may get annoyed if they are called multiple times
- Inbound customers who have a high probablity of buying and are matched with a skilled RM are highly likely to buy a travel package.

6. What do they HEAR?
> What are they hearing others say?
> What are they hearing from friends?
> What are they hearing from colleagues?
> What are they hearing second-hand?
- Customers hear the automated phonecall system which speaks to them in a pleasant tone at an even speed.
- Customers will also hear the waiting music which is calming.
- Customers will hear RMs explain their best options and deals for them.
- Customers will hear from other end users reviews how easy it was to deal with the phone system and the RMs were.
- RMs will hear from their colleagues how the new information system makes their job easier and helps them get sales.

7. What do they THINK and FEEL?
> PAINS | What are their fears, frustrations, and anxieties?
> GAINS | What are their wants, needs, hopes and dreams?
> What other thoughts and feelings might motivate their behavior?
- Customers who suffer long wait time will feel annoyed, unappreciated by the organisation and RM.
- Potential customers targeted by the system repeatedly will feel annoyed and view the company as untrustworthy if they have advised the RM to not call again.
- Customers calling in want to resolve their issue prompty, have detailed product information explained clearly by a knowledgable RM and purchased correctly handled when purchasing over the phone.
- 

# Assumptions
- The company has more than one RM’s that can be paired with a customer looking for a specific holiday package. This means inbound calls can be linked to two or more RM’s and the customer can easily be transferred between different RMs.
- Profiler tool uses work database based on the amount of cases closed on a specific holiday package and company database about personal information such as age, culture and sex.
- Customer will always have the choice to speak to a human operator when the Automatic Call Distributor fails to appropriately select an RM
- The system automatically creates a profile for new customers as needed and the designated RM can view or edit them as neccesary

# Reflections
## Peter
I think design thinking is good to look at other stakeholders’ POV. It has helped us to see what the next design steps we should be taking for the specifications. As for Github, I had trouble with GitHub as it was my first time using it. I felt like it wasn’t the best for making a report, but with the help of other I was able to do things. I believe the empathy map really helped with evaluating what needs to improved for the design specifications.
## Long
Design thinking is an appropriate process for most projects that follow the agile framework and provide flexible guidelines that help direct the next step in the development of the system. While an effective framework when applied well, I have found that there is potential for duplicate work to occur, not just from different team members, but from the same individuals during the first few stages. Specifically in various methods of empathising, the empathy map had some overlap with POV statements. Otherwise, as long as we keep the current project velocity ongoing, we should be able to finish the project report on time.
## Jake
As a student majoring in Interaction Design, I have some familiarity with the design thinking process and its aplication to various areas. At its core, design thinking is about ensuring that throughout the process of creating an information system, the end users and their needs are considered. This has become particularly important throughout the process of this assessment, wherein there are a large amount of stakeholders for us to consider. The needs of relationship managers, customers, and the company itself are all equally important, and through using design thinking, we have been able to keep our approach human-centred. Although at times it feels as though producing such a large number of figures can become redundant, it is important as it gives system developers a lot of information to use.
## Linh
Design thinking is an essential process for us to learning how to brainstorm and practice it in a right way to discovery solutions for problems which we have to deal with. Furthermore, it train us on generating and developing creative ideas independently while every failure lead us to different ways of thinking and others paths will be explore.In addition, we got more and more confidence in expressing our ideas to others. In addition, Empathy helps us understand how our users are feeling so that we can list and prioritize  exactly what they needs, which reduces amount of time on developing products to fit with customers requirements.

## Benefits of the System 

There are many clear benefits to the development of the information system that supports the new methods of inbound and outbound calling that will be used by the Call management Centre. The main functions of this system are to improve the call flow rate of the call center, by routing calls to the most appropriate Relationship Manager for each customer. Furthermore, it will grade each Relationship Manager, allowing the profiler tool to make skill ratings that will help to make the calls more efficient. The system will have major benefits for all of the stakeholders within the system; customers, relationship managers, and the company itself by making more sales.

Customers will find that their calls will be received and dealt with at faster rates than before. This is related to matching customers with the correct RMs; by doing so, customers will find that the RM that they talk to is more knowledgeable of the holiday package being sold to them. This will increase customer satisfaction both in the level of service, as well as the speed for each interaction. Moreover, in terms of outbound calls, customers will find that they are targeted more accurately by calls related to their needs and wants. While a small minority of customers may always find outbound calls dissatisfactory, the majority may be pleased by being contacted with information tailored to them that helps them find holiday packages that suit them. Similarly, in busy times, the combination of the typical information systems with the Interactive Voice Response unit will allow for less congestion and waiting time. 

Relationship Managers will receive large amounts of benefits when it comes to the creation of the Information System. Although they will initially have to complete a ten minute quiz, by gaining a good idea of their knowledge, the quality of their own calls will be increased. By serving customers with needs and wants more related to their own skills, RMs will face less anxiety at work of having to deal with customers seeking information on areas that they do not know well. Likewise, they will be able to track areas in which they need to improve their knowledge in order to increase their job performance and potentially commissions. Furthermore, by matching them with customers more likely to buy packages, commission receiving RMs will be able to earn more, both through the suitability of customers and through the speed at which they can now meet them.

While simplistic, the benefits to the company are extremely clear. By serving more customers, with better service, in a more tailored and efficient way, the travel company will likely see increased profits. Similarly, as referred to in the section on Relationship Managers, they will see greater employee satisfaction within their company, as well as better trained employees who are more aware of their strengths and weaknesses. 

Holistically, the implementation of such a system is beneficial for all stakeholders in the system, on several levels. Although the initial implementation may cause an adjustment period, the long term benefits cannot be ignored.
